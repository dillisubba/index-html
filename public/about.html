<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented Front-End Web Developer based in Tallmadge, OH,
   with hands-on experience in crafting responsive and visually compelling web applications.
    Proficient in core technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I leverage Angular 
    and React to build intuitive user interfaces and enhance user experiences. My expertise extends 
    to state management with Redux and integrating Bootstrap for mobile-first design. In addition to
     my development skills, I bring a unique perspective from my role as a Nepali Interpreter, where I 
     honed my ability to facilitate clear communication and problem-solving. Currently, I am expanding
      my skill set with backend programming through Udemy, continuously aiming to bridge the gap between 
      front-end and back-end technologies to deliver comprehensive web solutions.</p>
